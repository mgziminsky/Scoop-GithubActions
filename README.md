# Github actions for [Shovel](https://github.com/Ash258/Scoop-Core) buckets

Set of automated actions, which will save time when maintaining bucket, managing issues/pull requets. Using `main` tag instead of specific version is highly recommended.

## Available environment variables

1. `GITHUB_TOKEN`
    - **REQUIRED**
    - Use `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`
1. `SCOOP_BRANCH`
    - String
    - If specified, `shovel config 'SCOOP_BRANCH' $env:SCOOP_BRANCH` will be configured and shovel updated
1. `SKIP_UPDATED`
    - Anything. Use `1`
    - If specified, log of checkver utility will not print latest versions
1. `SPECIAL_SNOWFLAKES`
    - String
    - List of manifest names joined with `,` used as parameter for auto-pr utility.
1. `GITH_EMAIL`**
    - String
    - If specified this email will be used as author of commits
1. `GITH_USERNAME`
    - Default will be `github-actions[bot]`
    - If specified this username will be used as author of commits
    - Should be combined with GITH_EMAIL

**: `GITH_EMAIL` environment variable is not required since [1.0.1](https://github.com/Ash258/Scoop-GithubActions/releases/tag/1.0.1), but it is recommended.
If email is not specified, commits will not be pushed using account bounded to the email. This will lead to not adding contributions. ([See as example commit from github action without user's email](https://github.com/phips28/gh-action-bump-version/commit/adda5b22b3c785eb69d328f91dadb49a4c34a82e))
